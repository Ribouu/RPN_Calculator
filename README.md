# RPN_Calculator
Here's my biggest work from my last year in highschool. It's till in progress, because I can't find some of the code (for the queue and the chained list) and I'm still translating (french to english) and commenting it.
I know it would need a graphical redesign.


The project is in Python, using the tkinter library.
When you run main.py, you have the choice between using the stack, the queue and the chained list. Most of the project is based on the stack, and it's the part that is the RPN Calculator. 

*RPN are the initials for Reverse Polish Notation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)*


## Setup and Run

Requires **Python 3.7+**. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


It only needs the tkinter library, which is included in Python. If it's not, run the following command :

    sudo apt-get install python3-tk

To run the program :
    
**Windows**

    py -3 lib/main.py
    
**Linux**

    python3 lib/main.py
